            Bitcoin maxis are like the "crazy ex" of the cryptocurrency
            world-they're always saying "it's going to the moon!" and "BTC is the only one that matters !", 
            but sometimes you wonder if they're just trying to convince themselves.
            <p>Bitcoin maxis are groupof enthusiasts who beleive that
            Bitcoin(BTC) is the only cryptocurrency that matters and that it will eventually replace all 
            other forms of currency, including fiat currency. They often hold a strong
            conviction that Bitcoin will increase in value over time. Hand
